                        <h5>Our Philosophy</h5>
                        <p>
                            The Montessori philosophy is more than the materials in the classroom, or the teacher giving lessons. It is an attitude toward children, a way of understanding their unique nature and allowing them to grow and develop to their fullest potential
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Although Dr. Maria Montessori is best known as an educator, she was a medical pioneer as well, becoming, in 1896, the first woman doctor in Italy. She began her work with children in insane asylums and in the slums of Rome, but soon came to believe that the educational principles she was developing applied to all children. She opened the first "Casa dei Bambini" or "Children's House" in 1907 in San Lorenzo, Italy. Her revolutionary ideas spread quickly, and training centers opened throughout the world. The Montessori Method came to the United States in 1912, but grew slowly at first. However, rapid growth began in the early 1950s, largely through the efforts of Nancy McCormick Rambusch, an early childhood educator and founder of the American Montessori Society, who was moved by an increasing concern over the quality of American education.
                        </p>
                        <a name="the_child"></a>
                        <h6>The Child</h6>
                        <p>
                            Like many other educational philosophers, Dr. Montessori believed that human beings pass through stages in their development. She called the first stage of life, from birth to six years, the stage of the absorbent mind. This is when children literally absorb impressions from their environment through the “pores” of all their senses as a sponge absorbs water. During this period, for example, children learn their mother tongue far more easily than an adult who struggles to learn a foreign language. The opportunities available in the environment will, therefore, be a major factor in determining the child’s intellect.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Dr. Montessori believed that during these early years of development, the child passes through sensitive periods, or times when he becomes attuned to acquiring particular knowledge or skills. He will work on gaining that knowledge or skill with an interest and concentration he can never again display for that particular kind of work. Because the child learns more easily during these sensitive periods, Dr. Montessori developed specific didactic (learning) materials designed to correspond to these sensitive periods and to meet their needs. We all know well the 3-year-old’s desire for order in his environment and need for a daily routine. This is his sensitive period for order manifesting itself.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Recent advances in child development have taught us the importance of respecting each child as an individual. Respect for the child was key to Dr. Montessori’s philosophy a century ago and still is today. She advocated respect for the child’s individuality by allowing freedom of choice of activity within a specially prepared environment, a natural and beautiful environment created to suit the nature of the child. The prepared environment allows each child the freedom to learn and develop at his own pace, according to his own capacities. Since the child chooses his own work, he is never pushed into something he is not ready for, or bored by something too elementary for him. In our classroom, we attempt to create a non-competitive environment where the child feels at home and can work according to his own tempo and unique nature. The teacher prepares the environment to meet the specific and ever-changing needs of the children in it. We respect the child’s inner rhythm when we allow repetition of activities and give him the time to work at his own pace. Only the child knows when he has satisfied his need for that activity, or has absorbed it. When we “follow the child,” as Dr. Montessori urged, we have the best chance of nurturing the child’s natural curiosity and love for knowledge.
                        </p>
                        <p><b>Independence</b> is another cornerstone in a Montessori classroom. Independence is encouraged at every turn, whether it is putting on one’s own coat, choosing one’s own work, or cleaning up after oneself at the snack table. Each small step towards independence builds confidence, self-esteem, and a positive self-concept.</p>
                        <a name="environment"></a>
                        <h6>The Environment</h6>

                        <p>Dr. Montessori believed that learning is accomplished by the individual himself. The child learns by means of the materials and his own active experience with them. He also learns from others in the environment. Each Montessori classroom has an age range of three years, which allows older children to teach the younger ones and provides the younger ones with a model for future learning. The teacher prepares the environment and gives the child lessons on how the materials are used, guiding the child through a progression of the activities in each curriculum area of the environment. Given the necessary minimum of stimulating interest in the materials, the child begins to manipulate, discover, and learn for himself.</p>
                        <p>Exposure to the physically and mentally prepared environment causes a balancing of behavior to develop. As the child becomes absorbed in meaningful work that he chooses himself and which thus meets his needs, he works with continued concentration and inner satisfaction. When we see this in a single child, we call it inner discipline. When we see it in a whole classroom, we call it normalization. It is truly impressive to see children working together peacefully, helping each other, sharing and caring for one another.</p>
                        <p>“The hand is the chief teacher of the child,” said Dr. Montessori. Montessori classrooms are the epitome of the “hands on” experience for the child. Children learn best by doing, and Dr. Montessori’s didactic materials are designed to achieve sensory, motor, and intellectual development through a graduated system of learning in which children master simple, concrete concepts before progressing to the abstract. This can be seen in the classroom in several ways. Within the curriculum areas of the environment, children begin in the concrete areas of practical life and sensorial, and progress to the more abstract areas of math and language; within each curriculum area of the classroom, the children begin with the most simple lessons, and progress to the most difficult; and for each piece of material, there often is a simple and a more complex version of use. Many of the materials isolate one fundamental quality, such as color or dimension, so that the child learns to discriminate individual qualities in an object. Many of the materials are self-correcting, which provides the child with a control of error so they see their mistakes and are able to correct them without being afraid of making a mistake. Many of the materials are for self-discovery and do not require a lesson from the teacher; this encourages children to become independent of adults in seeking knowledge. Children have the freedom to choose and repeat any lesson they have been given, which allows them to satisfy their own desire to learn.</p>
                        <a name="teacher"></a>
                        <h6>The Teacher</h6>
                        <p>The role of the teacher (or directress, as Dr. Montessori called her) in the classroom is manifold. Her most important job is to foster a kind of learning that satisfies the child’s need to learn for its own sake, not to please others or receive praise. She is trained to observe carefully, to know the different needs of her children and to provide a properly prepared environment for the children’s maximum growth. She demonstrates the correct use of the materials, and guides without interfering with the child’s experience. She ensures that each child progresses through the activities of each curriculum area in the classroom. She sets limits, encourages the hesitant child, diverts the child that has chosen work too difficult, and keeps enthusiasm alive. She is there when needed, but “invisible” when not needed. In other words, she follows the child.</p>
                        <p>Dr. Montessori believed that learning is individual -- each child is encouraged to learn for himself -- and that children are motivated to learn by a natural curiosity and a love for knowledge. Therefore, early childhood education should cultivate the child’s own natural desire to learn -- to teach him how to learn. The Montessori Method develops a lifelong love of learning in every child.</p>

We also conduct sessions on music/dance/drama/art and craft to enhance their aesthetic sense.We greatly emphasize the need for hygiene, safety and cleanliness especially when young children spend most of their time with us, and in furtherance of the same goal, we provide lead free washable beds, non-toxic plastic trays and child friendly furniture amongst other things.

                  <p>Italy’s first female doctor and founder of the Montessori Method of Education, Maria Montessori was also a remarkable and courageous individual who recognised the potential of children in changing the nature of society provided they were nurtured and allowed to develop freely.</p>
                  <p>Thrice nominated for the Nobel Peace Prize, Maria Montessori was noted for her body of work as an educational reformist, advocator of women’s rights, humanitarian, professor of pedagogy, scientist, psychologist and anthropologist.</p>
                  <p>In 1954, two of Maria Montessori’s students Margaret Homfray and Phoebe Child established the St Nicholas trust with the support of Maria Montessori in order to train Montessorians to the highest calibre and facilitate the unification of the Montessori movement. Linda Madden, founder of the Rainbow Montessori schools was Margaret Homfray’s star pupil and protégé.</p>

                  <h5>The Montessori Method </h5>
                  <p> Developed by Dr Maria Montessori (1870-1952), is centred upon the belief that one should provide the most positive and harmonious development of the whole child. This ultimately prepares them for a rich lifetime of learning and experience.Maria Montessori observed the learning process within children of all creeds and backgrounds from birth to maturity.  She then distilled this into what is now recognized as the internationally acclaimed Montessori Method.</p>
                  <p>Maria Montessori’s ideas for the Montessori Method first began to take fruition during her time working with children as a doctor in Rome’s University Psychiatric clinic where she identified the importance of early years in the development of child.  Not long after in 1907, by then recognised as a talented scientist and academic, Maria Montessori was asked to singlehandedly run a project educating 50 underprivileged children from the slums outside Rome. The work Maria Montessori did with these children in the first ‘Children’s House’ and the outstanding results she made through her process of scientifically observing, nurturing, and designing educational materials has paved the way for the success of the Montessori Method as it is known today and started what is now widely known as the ‘Montessori Movement.’</p>

                      <h5 id="q1">How many students are typically in a Montessori class?</h5>
                      <p>Unlike some private schools, which strive for very small classes, Montessori values the lessons of community when the size of the class is somewhat larger. </p>
                      <p>Montessori classes for children above the infant &amp; toddler level might include 20–30 students whose ages span 3 years. All members of the community benefit from this set-up. Older students are proud to act as role models; younger ones feel supported and gain confidence about the challenges ahead. Classes for infants &amp; toddlers are smaller, with typically 10–15 children. </p>
                      <h5 id="q2">How can children learn if they're free to do whatever they want?</h5>
                      <p>Dr. Montessori observed that children are more motivated to learn when working on something of their own choosing. A Montessori student may choose his focus of learning on any given day, but his decision is limited by the materials and activities—in each area of the curriculum—that his teacher has prepared and presented to him.</p>
                      <p>Beginning at the elementary level, students typically set learning goals and create personal work plans under their teacher’s guidance. </p>
                      <h5 id="q3">Why are Montessori schools all work and no play?</h5>
                      <p>Dr. Montessori realized that children’s play is their work—their effort to master their own bodies and environment—and out of respect she used the term “work” to describe all their classroom activities. Montessori students work hard, but they don’t experience it as drudgery; rather, it’s an expression of their natural curiosity and desire to learn.</p>
                      <h5 id="q4">If children work at their own pace, don't they fall behind?</h5>
                      <p>Although students are free to work at their own pace, they’re not going it alone. The Montessori teacher closely observes each child and provides materials and activities that advance his learning by building on skills and knowledge already gained. This gentle guidance helps him master the challenge at hand—and protects him from moving on before he’s ready, which is what actually causes children to “fall behind.”</p>
                      <h5 id="q5">Do Montessori teachers follow a curriculum?</h5>
                      <p>Montessori schools teach the same basic skills as traditional schools, and offer a rigorous academic program. Most of the subject areas are familiar—such as math, science, history, geography, and language—but they are presented through an integrated approach that brings separate strands of the curriculum together. </p>
                      <p>While studying a map of Africa, for example, students may explore the art, history, and inventions of several African nations. This may lead them to examine ancient Egypt, including hieroglyphs and their place in the history of writing. The study of the pyramids, of course, is a natural bridge to geometry. </p>
                      <p>This approach to curriculum shows the interrelatedness of all things. It also allows students to become thoroughly immersed in a topic—and to give their curiosity full rein. </p>

                      <h5 id="q6">Is it true that Montessori students have the same teacher for all subjects rather than work with “specialists” in different curricular areas?</h5>
                      <p>Montessori teachers are educated as “generalists,” qualified to teach all sections of the curriculum. But many schools choose to also employ specialists in certain subjects, including art, music, foreign language, physical education, and science. </p>
                      <h5 id="q7">Why don't Montessori teachers give grades?</h5>
                      <p>Grades, like other external rewards, have little lasting effect on a child’s efforts or achievements. The Montessori approach nurtures the motivation that comes from within, kindling the child’s natural desire to learn. </p>
                      <p>A self-motivated learner also learns to be self-sufficient, without needing reinforcement from outside. In the classroom, of course, the teacher is always available to provide students with guidance and support. </p>
                      <p>Although most Montessori teachers don’t assign grades, they closely observe each student’s progress and readiness to advance to new lessons. Most schools hold family conferences a few times a year so parents may see their child’s work and hear the teacher’s assessment—and perhaps even their child’s self-assessment. </p>

                      <h5 id="q8">Do Montessori students take standardized tests?</h5>
                      <p>Public Montessori schools are mandated to administer the same standardized tests as other public schools. </p>
                      <p>Some private Montessori schools also administer standardized exams, particularly if they will be required by schools into which their students may transition. Other schools choose not to administer these tests.</p>
                      <h5 id="q9">Can Montessori accommodate gifted children? What about children with other special learning needs?</h5>
                      <p>An advantage of the Montessori approach—including multi-age classrooms with students of varying abilities and interests—is that it allows each child to work at her own pace. Students whose strengths and interests propel them to higher levels of learning can find intellectual challenge without being separated from their peers. The same is true for students who may need extra guidance and support: each can progress through the curriculum at his own comfortable pace, without feeling pressure to "catch up."</p>
                      <p>We might note that from a Montessori perspective, every child is considered gifted, each in her own way. For every child has his own unique strengths—it is all a matter of degree.</p>
                      <h5 id="q10">How well do Montessori students do compared to students in non-Montessori schools?</h5>
                      <p>There is a small but growing body of well-designed research comparing Montessori students to those in traditional schools. These suggest that in academic subjects, Montessori students perform as well as or better than their non-Montessori peers. </p>
                      <p>In one study, for example, children who had attended Montessori schools at the preschool and elementary levels earned higher scores in high school on standardized math and science tests. Another study found that the essays of 12-year-old Montessori students were more creative and used more complex sentence structures than those produced by the non-Montessori group. </p>
                      <p>The research also shows Montessori students to have greater social and behavioral skills. They demonstrate a greater sense of fairness and justice, for example, and are more likely to choose positive responses for dealing with social dilemmas. </p>
                      <p>By less stringent measures, too, Montessori students seem to do quite well. Most Montessori schools report that their students are typically accepted into the high schools and colleges of their choice. And many&nbsp;successful grads&nbsp;cite their years at Montessori when reflecting on important influences in their life.</p>

                    <h5 id="pq1">Are all Montessori schools alike?</h5>
                    <p>No, Montessori schools vary widely because the name “Montessori” is in the public domain. This means that anyone wishing to use the name “Montessori” for their school may do so. The best way to insure that a program is faithfully incorporating the Montessori approach as developed by Maria Montessori is to ask if the school or program is affiliated with AMI. </p>
                    <h5 id="pq2">What do children do in a Montessori program?</h5>
                    <p>There are several different, yet integrated, areas of learning in a Montessori classroom: practical life skills, sensorial development, language, mathematics, history, science, and cultural studies (geography, art, music). In addition to the available materials in each area, children might also take time out during the day to sing songs, read a story, or enjoy nature.</p>
                    <p>Children have both individual and group lessons in each area. Throughout the day, children are free to work with the activities. Emphasis is placed on helping children choose pursuits that are of interest to them, thus supporting the child’s natural curiosity and desire to learn. At the elementary (6-12 years) level, you can also expect to see children working together on projects, since collaboration at this age helps the child to become socially adapted to society and aware of the needs of others.</p>
                    <p>What you won’t see in a genuine Montessori program are systems of rewards and punishments to promote work or control behavior. There will be no lost recess, gold stars, or grades. In a Montessori class, children are engaged, active, and respectful because they are internally motivated, spending their time in an environment that consistently supports development of their will — that is, positive willpower and self-control.</p>
                    <h5 id="pq3">What is the advantage of having a three-year age span in the classroom?</h5>
                    <p>Children have a wide range of experiences, skills, abilities, and interests. A three-year age span in the classroom allows children the opportunity to use a wide range of engaging materials that keep them challenged to learn. As the child’s interests change, the range of available materials allows the child to move from one level of complexity to another.</p>
                    <p>Additionally, children have the opportunity to be learners and teachers simultaneously. This allows a child to experience the joy of providing leadership to those who are younger and the satisfaction of receiving useful assistance from those who are older or more skilled. It is a win-win for all the children in a Montessori classroom.</p>
                    <h5 id="pq4">How is discipline handled in a Montessori classroom?</h5>
                    <p>It is the development of self-discipline that is encouraged and valued. By maintaining a carefully prepared, structured environment that encourages exploration, creativity, and choice within clear boundaries, the child learns self-control and problem-solving skills that foster independence and responsibility. In this setting, discipline is viewed as a maturation process that evolves, supported by guidance from the teacher. With gentle, prudent assistance, children eventually become comfortable and equipped to accept the consequences of their own behavior. Skilled AMI-trained teachers use Montessori materials and activities to promote a classroom atmosphere that reinforces personal discipline and harmony by offering each child the opportunity to gain a sense of direction, confidence, cooperation, and self-control.</p>
                    <h5 id="pq5">Why is there such a non-competitive atmosphere in Montessori programs when we live in such a competitive world?</h5>
                    <p>In a Montessori program, children are on their own journey at their own pace toward maturity, acquisition of skills, and incorporation of knowledge. Therefore the emphasis is on assisting and supporting children to develop and learn based on their own interests, desires, and timing. Attention is also paid to promoting collaborative social and educational relationships that enhance learning through shared ideas and insights.</p>
                    <p>Using systems of rewards in the classroom distracts a child’s personal journey by intentionally directing his or her attention to the progress of other children. Ultimately, many studies have shown that competition inspired through the environment does little to build confidence or strengthen internal motivation and self-direction over the long-term. There certainly are situations where competitive activities can move children to greater efforts and improved skills, but as Maria Montessori stated, “The prize and the punishment are incentives towards unnatural or forced</p>
                    <h5 id="pq6">Do children have difficulty transitioning to a public school after going to a Montessori school?</h5>
                    <p>Moving from a Montessori school to another school setting is an issue often raised by parents and family members. Happily, the habits and skills a child develops in a Montessori class last a lifetime and stand a child in good stead no matter where they go. Montessori children tend to be adaptable, working well alone or with a group. They have solid decision-making skills, practical problem solving abilities, and generally manage their time well. Since children in a Montessori classroom are also encouraged to share ideas and discuss their work, fitting into new situations is made easier thanks to good communication skills.</p>
