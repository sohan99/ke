# &lt;animated-gallery&gt;
#### _This element was to be used for a seperate project which has now been completed. At this time I do not currently intend to work any further on this. Any pull requests are welcome, however._

This Polymer element displays an animated material design gallery (similar to the one shown [here](https://www.google.com/design/spec/components/grid-lists.html#)). Images are defined in an array with a `Title` and `Description` as well as the `URL`. Images are loaded using [iron-ajax](https://elements.polymer-project.org/elements/iron-ajax) and animations use [neon-animation](https://elements.polymer-project.org/elements/neon-animation).
