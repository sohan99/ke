      <p>Italy’s first female doctor and founder of the Montessori Method of Education, Maria Montessori was also a remarkable and courageous individual who recognised the potential of children in changing the nature of society provided they were nurtured and allowed to develop freely.
      </p>

      <p>Thrice nominated for the Nobel Peace Prize, Maria Montessori was noted for her body of work as an educational reformist, advocator of women’s rights, humanitarian, professor of pedagogy, scientist, psychologist and anthropologist.
      </p>
      <p>In 1954, two of Maria Montessori’s students Margaret Homfray and Phoebe Child established the St Nicholas trust with the support of Maria Montessori in order to train Montessorians to the highest calibre and facilitate the unification of the Montessori movement. Linda Madden, founder of the Rainbow Montessori schools was Margaret Homfray’s star pupil and protégé.

      <p class="heading">The Montessori Method</p>

      <p>Developed by Dr Maria Montessori (1870-1952), is centred upon the belief that one should provide the most positive and harmonious development of the whole child. This ultimately prepares them for a rich lifetime of learning and experience.Maria Montessori observed the learning process within children of all creeds and backgrounds from birth to maturity. She then distilled this into what is now recognized as the internationally acclaimed Montessori Method.
      </p>
      <p>Maria Montessori’s ideas for the Montessori Method first began to take fruition during her time working with children as a doctor in Rome’s University Psychiatric clinic where she identified the importance of early years in the development of child. Not long after in 1907, by then recognised as a talented scientist and academic, Maria Montessori was asked to singlehandedly run a project educating 50 underprivileged children from the slums outside Rome. The work Maria Montessori did with these children in the first ‘Children’s House’ and the outstanding results she made through her process of scientifically observing, nurturing, and designing educational materials has paved the way for the success of the Montessori Method as it is known today and started what is now widely known as the ‘Montessori Movement.’
